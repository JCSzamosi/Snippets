Snippets
========

* [tax_tables.R](./tax_tables.R)
	* A snippet to make taxon abundance tables in R. Adds an "other" category so
	the bars are all the same height.
* [SE_tidyverse.Rmd](./SE_tidyverse.Rmd)
	* A snippet showing how to use standard evaluation (non-non-standard
	evaluation) to pass a column name as a variably in tidyverse.
* [SaveInLoop.Rmd](./SaveInLoop.Rmd)
	* A snippet for saving plots to devices like `pdf()` in a for loop. You need
	`print()` or the plot is not generated and you get an empty file.
* [pca_biplot.Rmd](./pca_biplot.Rmd)
	* Making biplots from scratch is worth doing because it gives you total
	flexibility to colour your points and choose which loadings to display, but
	it's a pain. Here's an example.
